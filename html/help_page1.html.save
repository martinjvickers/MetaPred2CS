<H3> General Information</H3>
MetaPred2cs is a meta-predictor specifically designed to predict interactions in prokaryotic two-component system, 
i.e the pairing between histidine kinases and response regulators. 

MetaPred2cs is a meta-predictor which created based on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17160063">Support Vector Machine (SVM)</a>
by combining 6 individual sequence based protein-protein interaction prediction
methods to be able to predict <b> prokaryotic two-component system </b> protein-protein interactions (PPIs).
In the most general way, employed sequence based prediction methods can be classified
as co-evolutionary and genomic context methods. As co-evolutionary methods, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11933068">in-silico
two hybrid (i2h)</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11707606">mirror tree (MT)</a> methods used and genomics context
methods are: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15947018">phylogenetic profiling (PP)</a>, 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10573422">gene fusion (GF)</a>,
<a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030043">gene neighbourhood (GN)</a> 
and <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030043">gene operon methods (GO)</a>.

<h4>Fasta Files</h4>
Sequences of query proteins should be uploaded in fasta format as separate files and
the header of fasta files should be as it shown below.<br>
Example Header:<br>
>gi|16128384|ref|NP_414933.1| response regulator in two-component regulatory system
with PhoR (or CreC) [Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655]<br>
Fasta files in required format can be downloaded from <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/">here</a>.<br>

<H3> Result Table</H3>

At result table of server, users will see 3 columns which are ID of query proteins
(that will be composed by the locul tags of query proteins), class of result and the MetaPred2cs score.
Here in class section only 2 different variables can be seen and these variables are -1 or +1.
-1 is representing that the query proteins are not positively interacting so user will see prediction score as 0 for that query.
However if the query classified as +1 then user will be able to see a prediction score. Scoring range of MetaPred2cs is 0-1.<br>
<br>Based on prediction score, predictions can be classified as <b>high confidence</b>, <b>medium confidence</b> or <b>low confidence</b>.
Score ranges of these classes are defined as <b>0.999-0.700</b>, <b>0.699-0.400</b> and <b>0.399-0.000</b>, respectively.<br><br>
Example result table can be seen below.

<H3>Important Point</H3>

<b>=></b> MetaPred2cs is trained on <b> single domain </b> two-component system protein-protein interactions.
For this reason, to be able to perform predictions for <b>hybrid</b> two-component system proteins,
users need to work at domain level. In other words, protein sequences of domains of hybrid proteins should be given
separately instead of complete protein sequence.<br><br>
