<H3> Result </H3>
Depends on the parameters which selected by user, reaching result page can be time consuming.
For this reason, at the result page: employed files and used parameters by server during the calculation will be seen
beside MetaPred2CS result as tables.<br>
At result table of server, users will see 3 columns which are ID of query proteins
(that will be composed by the locul tags of query proteins), class of result and the prediction score.
Here in class section only 2 different variables can be seen and these variables are -1 or +1.
-1 is representing that the query proteins are not positively interacting so user will see prediction score as 0 for that query.
However if the query classified as +1 then user will be able to see a prediction score. Scoring range of MetaPred2cs is 0-1.<br>
Based on prediction score, predictions can be classified as <b>high confidence</b>, <b>medium confidence</b> or <b>low confidence</b>.
Score ranges of these classes are defined as <b>0.999-0.700</b>, <b>0.699-0.400</b> and <b>0.399-0.000</b>, respectively.<br><br>
Example result page can be seen below.

<H3>Important Points</H3>

<b> 1) </b> MetaPred2CS is trained on <b> single domain </b> two-component system protein-protein interactions.
For this reason, to be able to perform predictions for <b>hybrid</b> two-component system proteins,
users need to work at domain level. In other words, protein sequences of domains of hybrid proteins should be given
separately instead of complete protein sequence.<br><br>

<b> 2) </b> During the MSA reducing step of i2h and MT methods, if required minimum number of common species
not ensured calculation will be terminated. Under this circumstance, users should <b> lower </b> the <b> min matches limit </b>
or <b> higher </b> the <b> b_value </b> and <b>restart</b> the job.
