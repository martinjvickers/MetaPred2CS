The starting point for these programs are the multiple sequence alignments of the 
individual proteins in PIR format.

The names of the proteins in the PIR files should be in a swisprot-like format:
>P1;xxxxx_<species-identifier>
For example:
>P1;PSBP_HOMO
>P1;HBB_especies1
>P1;hba_org2
The species identifier should be the same in all the PIR files since it is used to match
sequences from the same species.

* Make a symbolic link of the "i2hbin_XXX" directory to the directory where you 
are going to work with the name "i2hbin". XXX is the architecture (Sun, SGI, Linux, ...).
For example:
ln -s /programs/i2h/i2hbin_SGI ~/working/i2hbin
   
* There are two main scripts for running the system:

1) i2hbin/alnpirs2corr.sh   prot1.pir  prot2.pir   min_matches  max_matches   (corr||rankorr)   matrix  results_file(append)
This script runs the pair of proteins whose alignments are in  "prot1.pir" and "prot2.pir". 
"min_matches" and "max_matches" are the minimum and maximum number of common species between the
two proteins required to run that pair. In general, don´t use min_matches<11.
The 5th argument specifies the type of correlation calculation used ("rankorr" is computationally
more expensive).
"matrix" is the residue homology matrix used for the calculations. There are two matrices included
with the program: "i2hbin/Maxhom_McLachlan.metric" and "i2hbin/Maxhom_GCG.metric".
Finally, the last argument is the name of the file where the final results will be stored. The
results will be append to the file (it will not be overwritten).

2) i2hbin/generatepairnames  file(list_of_pirfiles)  program_to_run_pair   (system|stdout)  [rest of arguments ...]
This program is just a front-end to the previous one.
It takes as second argument a file containing the list of PIR files (1 per line). Then, it generates 
all possible pairs among these PIR files and build the command line described in "1)" for all 
those pairs. Depending on the 3rd argument (system|stdout), these command lines generated can 
be executed or printed to the screen (stdout). With this last option you can generate a script 
file with the command lines for running all the pairs and then execute it latter, split it to 
run in different machines, etc.
The first argument "program_to_run_pair" is generally "i2hbin/alnpirs2corr.sh", described in "1)"
The last arguments of the command line "[rest of arguments ...]" are the arguments passed to
the program which runs the pairs (except "prot1.pir  prot2.pir"). That is 
"min_matches  max_matches   (corr||rankorr)   matrix  results_file(append)"

* The file with the results will contain the list of pairs and four values for each pair, the
"interaction index" value from i2h, the "mirrortree" value, the sequence identity between the two 
proteins (%/100) and the number of sequences of common species used to make the
calculations.

We are very interested to know of any result (good, bad, interesting) that you obtain with these
programs. That would help us to improve them. We would appreciate if you can comment us on those 
results. Send your comments, questions, problems with the program, etc.
